title: Under the Same UmbrelOS
description: How I finally found a self-hosting setup that doesn't make me want to throw my computer out the window.

I've always been a fan of **homelabbing**. Over the years I've tried all kinds of approaches — and let's just say *a few hard drives didn't survive the journey*. **RIP.** Between drive failures and endless tinkering with **Raspberry Pis**, I always assumed self-hosting was just meant to be a painful experience.

Then life gave me a window of free time to actually play around with this stuff, and I decided to give it another proper shot. I started with **CasaOS**, which looked promising, but it never quite clicked for me. Something was always slightly off — whether it was the feature set, the workflow, or just the overall feel. It didn't satisfy me enough to stick with it.

So I kept looking.

## Finding UmbrelOS

Eventually I came across [UmbrelOS](http://umbrel.com/umbrelos) — and it changed everything. Umbrel is a **dashboard for all your self-hosted services**, designed to be as close to a *set-and-forget* experience as possible. That said, you still get to roll up your sleeves a little — which is half the fun, right? It wouldn't be as satisfying otherwise.

### What makes it great

It has everything you actually need:

- 🛍️ **App Store** — browse and install services via Docker with a single click
- 📦 **Hundreds of popular app images** ready to go
- 🔒 **2FA** and encrypted backup support
- 🗂️ Organized **data folders**
- ✨ A genuinely clean and well-thought-out **UI**

Under the hood, it runs on a **Debian-based OS**, which means tweaking low-level settings can be a bit tricky if you really want to go deep. But that same design is also what makes it a stable and consistent environment — perfect for non-technical people, or for anyone who just wants to run a few services without losing an entire weekend in the dark depths of their room.

## My Setup

Running it **headless** *(yes, I went there)* on an **old laptop** with a bunch of external drives attached for storage. It hums away quietly in a corner doing its thing, and I love it.

> If you've got an old PC, laptop, or Raspberry Pi collecting dust somewhere, **give it a try**. It's a great way to start your self-hosting journey — and it's actually a lot of fun.
