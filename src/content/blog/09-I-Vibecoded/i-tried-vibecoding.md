# I Tried Vibecoding. Here’s What Happened.

After my Twitter timeline (I will never call it X, sorry Elon </3 ) got flooded with takes like:

- *“How I VIBECODED my SaaS in 3 hours”*  
- *“Vibecoding is going to kill programmers”*

I decided to stop scrolling and approach this unexplored land. If everyone else was vibecoding, why shouldn’t I?

So I grabbed my infinite roll of paper — the one where I keep my **923,401 brilliant unicorn app ideas** — and picked one at random.

**A sticker tracking app.**

## Step 1: The Perfect Prompt™

From experience, I knew the best place to start was with a solid prompt.  
So I went to ChatGPT and asked it to craft the perfect prompt for Lovable based on my project idea.

Lovable.dev took that output and produced something… beautiful.

The frontend looked amazing.

There was just one small problem.

> Nothing worked.

Turns out the backend wasn’t part of the experience. Minor detail.

## Step 2: “Sure, Deploy the Database”

It suggested connecting to Supabase, so I did.

After a few follow-up questions, Lovable started generating SQL:

- Table creation scripts  
- Relationships  
- Even self-fixing some issues  

At some point it asked me to review the SQL.

But I was vibecoding.

So obviously I said yes without reading it.

The database was created. Then it moved on to generating the backend in `.tsx`.

It finished.

I tried to build.

**Build failed.**

Credits were over for the day. I’d continue tomorrow.  
**Time spent so far:** ~1 hour.

## The Dopamine Effect

Here’s the funny part: it was a pure dopamine bath.

Watching *my* words transform into something that would normally take me hours of research, implementation, and debugging — all compressed into 10 minutes — felt surreal.

I finally understood the hype.

It’s addictive. The immediate reward loop is powerful:

- Add one feature  
- Tweak something  
- Think “what if I also…”  
- Repeat forever  

It’s a never-ending story.

## Final Thoughts

After a few days of vibecoding, I had something that kind of worked.  
And I was kind of proud of it.

**Skills gained:** zero  
**Fun level:** 1,000,000,000  

I vibecoded.
